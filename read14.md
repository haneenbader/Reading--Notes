# Diversity and Inclusion
## Article 1:

* What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
Around 1984 is when something changed. There is no one answer, but one of them is the fact that personal computers appeared in homes around this time. These were more like toys marketed toward men and boys. Movies portrayed boys as computer nerds furthered this.

* Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? They entered into college for computer science already having a lot of experience, much the opposite from the 1970s.

## Article 2:

* What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

Still continuing from the article above.
Indiegogo at 50/50 jumped out at me. They are even with this, which is good to see.
Some companies have a broader range than others.

## Article 3:

* When are diversity efforts most successful?

If a company represents/matches the same diversity as their user-base, they will be more likely to meet every customer's need.
* Why do diverse companies perform better?

There are significant benefits to creativity and innovation.
Brings in different ways of seeing problems.
Companies perform better.
Ensures meeting every customer's needs.
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

The YouTube example was interesting. Almost all of their developer team that built the iOS app were right handed, causing 5-10% of videos to be uploaded upside down.

Keeping a vibrant working communinity that matches the same vibrancy of the user-base ensures a well rounded, stronger company to meet all needs of their users.
