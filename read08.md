# Web API Design
APIs should be able to support platform independence and service evolution.

REST - Representational State Transfer. An architecture for building web services.

# REST APIs
A REST API is designed regarding resources such as date, object, or a service accessible by the user.

Resources have identifiers, a URL.

Exchange of info with JSON.

Non-binding to the client.

HTTP requests are independent, can occur in any order.

Highly Scalable.

Maturity Model
Level 0 - Define URI plus all operations that are POST requests to URI. Level 1 - Create separate URIs for resources. Level 2 - Using HTTP methods for defining operations on these resources. Level 3 - Use hypermedia (HATEOAS).

REST models the APIs and keep the internal implementation away from the client.

use plural nouns when naming URIs

# Define your operations in HTTP methods.
* GET

* POST requests create resources.

* PUT requests updates existing or creates resources.

* PATCH partial updates to existing resources.

* DELETE

* HTTP protocol supports JSON and XML

* JSON patch and JSON merge patch are two options for the PATCH method.

* Use asynchronous operations if request may take long.

* filter methods can be passed along with a request to filter the desired data rather than searching through all the data to find the desired data. This can take a lot of bandwidth and time. Very inefficient.

* Paginate - return only a certain/controlled number of data, resources, etc.

* You can give a parameter to fetch a certain number of results.

* Larger resources may need to be requested in portions.

* HEAD - A HEAD request, similar to GET, only return HTTP headers that describe the resource desired.

* set Accept-Ranges in your Header to only accept a certain amount of data in the request.

# HATEOAS
* URI - Uniform Resource Identifier.

* HATEOAS - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State - clients interact with a certain network app whose app servers return information through hypermedia. Contains only the info necessary to shift to one atate from another.

* MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions - extends format of emails messages and supports attachments like audio/video.

* URI versioning - Adding a version number to the URI for each of the resources. This will allow other versions to continue to operate. This, however, may complicate HATEOAS.

* Query string versioning - add a version number of the desired resource using a parameter contained in your query string which will be appended to the HTTP request. Has some of the same complications with HATEOAS.

* Header versioning - use a custom header that indicates the desired version.

* Media type versioning - name the desired format using Accept in the header in the request.
