# React and Forms
Forms
HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:

# Example :

<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

# Controlled Components
In HTML, form elements such as , <textarea>, and typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState(). The file input Tag In HTML, an lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.

# Example :

<input type="file" />
Handling Multiple Inputs
When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

Controlled Input Null Value
Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.
