# What Google learned from the perfect team.
I read this in 201, but this article was interesting in the fact that there is no real catch-all best way to operate a team. It seems like the more people get along and that there is more of a personal connection between all the members of the team, the more productive that team functions. To the outsider, it may appear that they are quite the opposite, but the proof is in the result.

# REST
Roy Fielding - the originator of the Representational State Transfer, or REST.

# HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

* REST - gives us a definition of a resource. A page on the web is a represention or copy of the resource. The browser will request a resource and we get a representaion of that data in the form of a response. REST uses nouns and verbs.

* URL - Uniform Resource Locator, equivalent to a noun for machines.

* Servers communicate with one another to exchange information to fulfill a request.

* Polymorphism - different nouns have the possibilty of having the same verbs attached to them.

* Verbs
    - GET to retrieve data
    - POST to add files
    - PUT to replace something
    - PATCH to do a partial update
    - DELETE to delte files.
The concept of REST is applying these verbs to nouns.
