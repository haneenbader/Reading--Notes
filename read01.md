# What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

# Example :

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

# What are the charactistics of a component?
* Reusability.
* Encapsulated.
* Replaceable.
* Not context specific.
* Independent.
* Extensible.
 

# Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.


Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
