# What is OAuth?
* SSO - single sign-on

* 2FA - two-factor authentication

* MFA - multi-factor authentication

* OAuth - an open-standard authorization framework allowing unrelated servers to connect and securely allow authenticated access to assests without exposing or leaking vital information.

* This was started by Twitter and Google. Released in 2010 as an open standard. Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, and several others use this.

* Example - using google to log into multiple different websites. Or sending cloud stored files through your email. Two or more services being used for one transaction.

* OAuth is basically at least two sites that are unrelated working together with a user to achieve one result. OAuth is about authorization, NOT authentication. One source authenticates, the other that the user is trying to access is authorizing. The authorizer only has temporary access to this information.

* OpenID - an OAuth authentication layer

* SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language - more used for Saleforce.

* TLS - Transport Layer Security

# Authenication and Authorization Flows

* Auth0 - uses the OIDC(OpenID Connect) protocol in addition to the OAuth 2.0 version framework.

* Authentication = Verification

* Authorization = Verifies who gets in., second server

* Authorization Code Flows - the exchange of an authorization code in exchange for an access token.

* PKCE - Proof Key for Code Exchange - an additional layer for mobile apps, mainly single page apps.

* Implicit flow - intended for public clients. sites unable to store client secrets

* Hybrid flow - combines implicit and code flow with form post.

* Client credentials flow - (M2M) - machine to machine. This authorizes an app instead of the user.

* Device Flow - Authentication through devices. Gives you a temp code to authorize another device.

* Resource Owner Password Flow - sharing information. Recommended only for re-direct flows.
